                                People have two working memories: visuospatial sketchpad (visual) and phonological loop (verbal/phonological). 
                                To store things in memory, people need to convert information in their working memory into long term memory. 
                                There can be order effects depending on the sequence of memorization. You can remove the recency effect by having 
                                people do a distractor task.
                            </p>

                                This game models the two types of working memories well and also incorporates a distractor task into the recall phase. 
                                There are very direct connections to the curriculum.
